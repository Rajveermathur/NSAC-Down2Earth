<h3>&nbsp 1.<u><i><b> KALPANA CHAWLA, The First Indian Woman In Space</u></i></b></h3>
<p><br><br><br>Few names have captured the collective imagination of Indians in the past two decades as much as Kalpana Chawla. Kalpana was born in Karnal, Punjab, and went on to obtain a degree in aero-nautical engineering from Punjab Engineering College. She emigrated to the United States and became a naturalised citizen in the 1980′s. After procuring subsequent degrees from the University of Colorado and Texas, she started working for the NASA Ames Centre. She was selected as an Astronaut candidate in 1994 and went for her first mission in 1997 on Colombia STS-87, becoming the first Indian woman to go to space.<br><br>“When you look at the stars and the galaxy, you feel that you are not just from any particular piece of land, but from the solar system,” she remarked after her first space mission.<br>Kalpana was certified with a commercial pilot license for seaplanes, multi-engine aircraft and glider. She was also a certified flight Instructor for glider and aeroplanes.</p>

<h3>&nbsp 2.<u><i> ASHWINVASAVADA, Exploring Mars Via The Curiosity Rover</u></i></h3>
<p><br><br><br>Ashwin Vasavada, who holds a Doctorate in Planetary Science is currently a Senior Scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He has led the scientists' Roving Mars with the MSL mission and also worked on NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission, among many other career accomplishments. Vasavada has also won several accolades for his numerous contributions including the JPL People Leadership Award (2017), NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal (2013), NASA Group Achievement Award, and many more.Ashwin Vasavada was recently named Project Scientist for NASA’s Mars Rover Curiosity, thereby placing him in charge of a team of nearly 500 researchers around the globe. A former Deputy Project Scientist for the mission, he has spent more than a decade on the Mars Science Laboratory and knows the mission and its sub-system in a way that few others do. Vasavada, with his experience, was also a part of several spacecraft missions by NASA such as the Galileo Mission to Jupiter, the Cassini Mission to Saturn, Mars Polar Lander, and Mars Odyssey, and is excited about his new and challenging role. <br><br>As said by Vasavada <br> “Not just once-in-a lifetime experience, but one that many people never even get. It’s going to be an incredible few years, and worth whatever it takes.” </p>

<h3><br> &nbsp3.<u><i> SUNITA WILLLIAMS, Ranked Second In USA Endurance List Of Female Astronauts</u></i></h3>
<p><br><br>Sunita L. Williams is a Master of Science in Engineering Management. She was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998 to become the second Indian-American woman to hold the position at NASA after late Kalpana Chawla. She is a veteran of two major space missions. She also held a world record for females with four spacewalks at 29 hours and 17 minutes, however, the record was later broken by Peggy Whitson with five spacewalks.

Williams has also received several awards for her accomplishments including a Legion of Merit, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and Humanitarian Service Medal Navy Commendation Medal, among others.Sunita Williams became a household name in India, being only the second Indian-American Female Astronaut at NASA. But what helped her gain international recognition was when she set the record of the longest cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut with 50 hours and 40 minutes on seven Extra-Vehicular Activities as well as the longest spaceflight by a woman. Although she was born and brought up in the United States, India and her influences have always been close to her heart as she revealed on her visit to India in 2013. She took a copy of the Upanishads and a copy of the Bhagvad Gita to space to reflect and read, and even took samosas to space! Sunita is all set to be a part of NASA’s commercial launches which will culminate into the mission to land an American on Mars by 2030. She will be working with Space X and Boeing in designing and studying the systems required for launches from the International Space Station.</p>

<h3><br> &nbsp 4.&nbsp<u><i>V. Dr. KAMLESH LULLA, Helping Astronauts Land Safely Through Remote Sensing</u></i></h3>
<p><br><br>One of the most celebrated scientists at NASA, Vadodara born Dr. Lulla is said to have his office walls covered more with awards than paint. With more than 27 years of work experience at NASA, Lulla has helped astronaut crews through the development of astronaut-directed Earth remote sensing and even served as the lead scientist for Earth-looking payloads. A prolific author, he has taken part in various initiatives to spread space exploration knowledge and interest besides writing several scientific and technical papers and books.Kamlesh Lulla is among the most internationally acclaimed scientists at the American space agency. He also holds two Ph. D. degrees with specialization in Environmental science and Geoscience remote sensing.

Throughout his career, he has been tasked with several chief scientific roles including the International Space Station Program, Earth Observations and Remote Sensing in the Space Shuttle Program. Some of his biggest accolades include the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal, the Ellison Onizuka Award and NASA Achievement Medal.</p>

<h3><br> &nbsp 5.&nbsp<u><i>Dr. ANITA SENGUPTA, Creating A State of Matter And Landing Rovers</u></i></h3>
<p><br><br>Anita Sengupta is an aerospace engineer who has worked on developing numerous technologies that enabled Mars, Asteroids, and Deep Space exploration. She was also among the chief engineers behind the launch of Curiosity Rover to Mars in 2011.Anita’s childhood fascination with science fiction and curiosity lead her to a career as a project manager in Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She was responsible for designing the 70 foot parachute that slowed the descent of the Curiosity Rover into Mars in March 2012, but her most exciting breakthrough has come in creating a state of matter called the Bose-Einstein Condensate, which will soon debut on the International Space Station in the latter half of 2016 as a part of NASA’s Cold Atom Laboratory. She is also a strong advocate for inclusion of more women in the field and believes, “Space exploration and related scientific endeavours don’t have to be the stuff of white men in lab coats.”</p>
